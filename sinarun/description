The goal? Simply make the best time! What will make you different from others players is not the cheap ability you'll get on the playground. It's how good you'll be at optimizing jumps, turns and general route-finding. The race is 100% pure.

The game is designed to be Easy to Play, Hard to Master. You should be able to pick-up the game and play it correctly after some try. Thing is how many 'try' will you need to be the best?
