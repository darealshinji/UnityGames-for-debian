There have been rumors spreading about the abandoned old cloth factory next to your office block. Some say, at night, spirits of the workers killed during the years before work safety regulations haunt the place, possess inanimate objects, and kill indiscriminately.

But you are unaware of these rumors for the most part, and after an intern in your office screws up an investor database, you decide to stay behind and fix the mess. Minutes later, you awake on your desk, and immediately realise that something is very wrong. The lights are broken, your colleagues are nowhere to be seen, and the very office itself has become dark and foreboding.

You know there is something out there in the darkness, and that you should get to the clearing near the main road, where the lights of civilization await.

Follow the trees, find the light, and do not stare at the enemies for too long, or find yourself drawn into the madness beyond.
