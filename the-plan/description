A fly ascends to the skies, pondering the pointlessness of its brief existence.
The Plan was developed as a side project by Krillbite Studio, who's currently finishing their main project Among the Sleep.

The Plan is a free atmospheric videogame, exploring issues of death and meaning.
Being a rather short and experimental project, it's suitable for those who usually don't play as much and/or have little spare time, even though we think The Plan will appeal to a wide range of people as well.
