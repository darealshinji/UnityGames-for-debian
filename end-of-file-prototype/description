End of File is a first person 'perspective' puzzle game. The emphasis is on observation and exploration. The world, an abstraction of a broken piece of software that you are attempting to traverse and understand.

It was developed as a student project at the Victoria University of Wellington as part of one of our courses. After the course some of us spent a little more time adding a bit more polish so the game could be released to the public.
