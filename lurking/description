Lurking is a sound-based survival thriller, where sound is the only way you see, and they hear your fears.

Imagine, being engulfed by absolute darkness, and the only way to "see" is by create an "audio pulse" by walking or throwing objects. Take that, and add the notion that enemies in the game track you through these sound you make. Now, how do you "see" enough to escape and yet not get caught?

Lurking also features microphone input support that picks up and convert the real world sounds made you the player into in-game audio pulses. This creates a secondary level of immersion by allowing the enemies to hear your fear As such the use of a microphone headset is strongly recommended.
