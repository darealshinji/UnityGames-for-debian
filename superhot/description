SUPERHOT is a unique, stylish first-person shooter game where time moves only when you move.

With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.

Take your time. You have as much as you want.

It started out as a 7 Day First Person Shooter (7DFPS) game jam project made by a group of friends in August 2013. After releasing the prototype of SUPERHOT to the Internet, it quickly became very popular.
