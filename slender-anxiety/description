Slender: Anxiety is a horror game created by Hades Productions, based on Slender by Parsec Productions. It is a story-driven horror game which is more of a remake to Slender: The Arrival. Slender: Anxiety takes place on the lens of a camcorder, and will follow gameplay similar to Slender: The Arrival. It will have the same collection mechanic featured in Slender: The Arrival. Even though the same collection mechanic will be used, it won't be PAGES that you are collecting and will be different maps and a storyline which shows the reason of the maps.
