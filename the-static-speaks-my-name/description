A dark, sad, funny, weird 1st person exploration game in which you play as a man obsessed with the meaning behind a painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Features 3D computer graphics in hundreds of colors (blue and pink to name a few). Contains explicit handling of suicide, so be warned. There is also a shrimp tank with pet shrimp.
