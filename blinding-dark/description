We asked ourselves, what would happen if Amnesia and Clive Barkerâ€™s: Undying had a baby? The result would be Blinding Dark, a First Person Shooter horror game. Complete puzzles, collect items and power-ups, fight enemies and do your best to manage the very thin resources you have at your disposal. Blinding Dark will have a total of 6 Acts and each Act will take place in a different environment while adding to the story and gameplay.
