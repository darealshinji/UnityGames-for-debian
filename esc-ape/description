Delta g Arena is a first person variable gravity training exercise. You must navigate an arena of floating platforms using only your ability to modify your own local gravity by firing at a surface to make it the new "floor," and a limited ability to drag yourself towards a target. The simulation has a time limit, but reaching specific highlighted platforms will extend your timer. Going outside of the arena immediately ends the simulation.

This is a very simple game-jam old-fashioned play-for-a-high-score kind of exercise, which can admittedly be pretty frustrating at first, but once you have the hang of it you can get around the arena surprisingly quickly.
