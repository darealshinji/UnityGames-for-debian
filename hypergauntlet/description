Hyper Gauntlet: The Legacy of Nozzlethrust III is a manic-paced arcade first person infinite runner influenced by Super Hexagon, BIT.TRIP Runner, Wipeout and Temple Run. Players control an invisible force in an abstract and minimalist arena, constantly hurtling forwards through gaps between blue and red obstacles. As obstacles are passed and the score increases, the player runs faster and faster. To help them in their never-ending race, the player can slow down time for a few seconds to dodge through a particularly tricky section. The game rewards you for making split-second decisions and never taking the easy way out. It is currently in Late Alpha stages, and will soon be entering Early Beta.
